Welcome to gprMax Designer's documentation!
===========================================

gprMax Designer is a graphical application designed in order to facilitate gpr modelling with gprMax 3. Project is written in Python and is distributed as free software under GNU GPL 3 license.

This documentation has been generated with Sphinx from docstrings scattered throughout the application code with other potential developers in mind. If you want to improve the application, feel free to adjoin. Any feedback will be warmly welcome.

The application has been developed as a master's thesis on the Faculty of Geology, Geophysics and Environmental Protection of AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow. The thesis supervisor is Mr Jerzy Karczewski, Ph. D.

Should any questions arise, do not hesitate to contact me at tsiwek@g.pl or via project github repository (https://github.com/tomsiwek/gprMax-Designer).
