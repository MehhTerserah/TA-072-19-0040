.. module:: settings module.
:synopsis: Module contains a few classes that encapsulate various application
           settings, eg. window and model size, label ticks settings etc...
           The settings are organised into following classes: TWindow_Size,
           TModel_Size, TTicksSettings, TSurveySettings, and TColours.
